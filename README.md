Quick sort
---

1. *Quicksort is a divide and conquer algorithm. Quicksort first divides a large array into two smaller sub-arrays: the low elements and the high elements. Quicksort can then recursively sort the sub-arrays.* From Wikipedia

2. **Complexity**

* Best - O(n log(n))

* Average - O(n log(n))

* Worst - O(n^2)

3. `this is code`

Bubble sort
---

1. *Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted.* From Wikipedia

2. **Complexity**

* Best - O(n)

* Average - O(n^2)

* Worst - O(n^2)

3. `this is code`

Merge sort
---

1. *Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm. Conceptually, a Merge sort works as follows: 1) Divide the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing 1 element (a list of 1 element is considered sorted), 2) Repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only 1 sublist remaining. This will be the sorted list.* From Wikipedia

2. **Complexity**

* Best - O(n log(n))

* Average - O(n log(n))

* Worst - O(n log(n))
