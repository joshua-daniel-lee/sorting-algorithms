Implementing Sorting Algorithms

For this assignment you will be responsible for the following:

Create a module that implements each of the folowing sorting algorithms:
Quick sort
Bubble sort
Merge sort
Insertion sort
Selection sort
Each module should be able to sort a randomized array of numbers.

Create a README.md file and for each algorithm include the following:

Explain to a five year old how the algorithm works (3-4 sentences max)

Psuedo code for each sorting implementation

In your own words, describe the performance of the alogirthm for the following cases:

Best case scenario

Worst case scenario

Stretch Goal - Create a web app that visually sorts a randomized group via with DOM manipulation. Your web app should be able to be used based on user input. Your site doesn't need to be to fancy, here is an example of how it might look Sorting Algorithms Visualized.

Note: Quick Sort and Merge Sort are difficult to visualize in the DOM. Do these last.
